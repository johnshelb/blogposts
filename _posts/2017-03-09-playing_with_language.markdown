title:  "Playing with Language"

I have always loved language.  From childhood  I have been a voracious reader and I especially enjoy writers such as James Joyce in whose works the play of language is often foregrounded.  Even playing with individual words and teasing them apart to speculate about their origins has been a fascination of mine.  This is partly what led me to study ancient Greek and Latin.  So it should come as no surprise that I really enjoy crossword puzzles.  I try to do the New York Times puzzle each week from Thursday to Sunday, but I am especially excited when I get to attempt a cryptic.


If you have seen  cryptic crosswords, sometimes called British-style crosswords, without knowing how they work, you were probably very confused.  This is because the clues in a cryptic are, well, cryptic.  Each clue in a cryptic is a miniature word puzzle.  A bit of experience helps a lot, as there are certain patterns that cryptic clues often fall into.

Every cryptic clue can be read at least two different ways.  Each clue contains a straightforward, crossword-style definition as well as some kind of word play.  There often will also be an indicator as to what the word play is.  The trouble is that it is not always immediately clear where the division between the two parts of the clue is.  To help a bit, the number of letters in the answer is given in parentheses after the clue.  Punctuation, if present, is more likely to be misleading than helpful, so it is best to ignore it.


Chaperone shredded corset (6)

Again, if you've never seen a cryptic before, you might have no idea what to do with this.  But the experienced solver will start by trying to figure out where the straight definition is and where the wordplay lies.  In a short clue like this, there are only a few possibilities:  the straight definition must be either:

   -chaperone

   -chaperone shredded
	 
	 -shredded corset
	 
	 or
	 
	 -corset
 
 With some practice, it becomes clear that 'shredded' might not be part of the definition, but is indeed, an indicator of the wordplay.  Following that up with fact that we know the answer has 6 letters, and noticing that one of the words in the clue (corset) also has 6 letters, it becomes clear that what the clue is asking us to do is to find a word that is defined by 'chaperone' that can be formed by 'shredding' the 6-letter word, 'corset.'  Any term such as 'crazy,' 'drunk,' 'reeling,' 'weird,' etc. may indicate that there is an anagram at work.  I case you don't remember, an anagram is a word that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word.  For example, 'tore' and 'rote' are anagrams of each other.  Anagrams are one very common type of cryptic clue.  So, can you shred 'corset' into a word that could mean chaperone?  (Answers will come at the end.)
 
 Another type of clue is called a Charade.  This involves putting together individual words to form a different word.  An example from a recent cryptic in the Times:
 
 Prevent the free speech of a lady in pop music (4)
 
 Here the straight definition is "lady in pop music" while the wordplay is "prevent the free speech of a."
 
 To 'prevent the free speech of' is to 'gag.'  Tacking on the 'a' gives us 'gaga.'  Lady in pop music?  Of course, Gaga.
 
 Here's another example for you:
 
 Common digit yet more deadened (7)
 
 
 Another type of clue is known as a container.  This is when the answer is contained inside a word, or group of words in the clue:
 
 Do in Superman (4)
 
 As usual, the tricky part is that the surface sense of the clue is there to distract you.  Most of us read this clue as meaning the same thing as 'Kill Superman,' but that is not right sense.  Here, 'in' is serving as an indicator that we are looking for some string (of 4 letters) inside the word 'Superman' that might be clued by "Do."
 
 
Another common type of clue is a homophone.  Homophones are words that sound the same, but are spelled differently, such as 'night' and 'knight.'  For a homophone cryptic clue to work, there must be some indicator that you are looking for something that sounds like the word.  Here's an example:

According to hearsay, big star is not working (4)

The "According to hearsay" bit is telling you that you are looking for a word that sounds like it means 'big star' but actually means 'not working'

Here's another:

Features of a lion articulated in part of a sentence (4, 6)

Another type of clue you may encounter is the double definition.  In this type, both parts of the clue can be considered straightforward crossword-style definitions, just not what you would immediately think.

For example:

Syrian strongman equally down in the dumps (5)

If you've seen the news in the past year or so, Syrian strongman may immediately make you think of the Syrian leader Assad.
Equally down in the dumps?  As sad.

Okay here's a harder one for you to try:

Beef and fish (4)


This has just been a sampling of a few of the types of clues that you may find in a cryptic.  For those of you who detest this sort of thing, I will avoid trying your patience by going through the seven or eight other commonly found types, but there are many places on the web where you can find full explanations of the clue types, as well as lots of puzzles.


What does this have to do with learning to code?  Well, the state of mind required for solving a cryptic does seem to me to be at least tangentially related to that of solving a coding problem.  One must be sharply focused on the given situation, but it is at least as important to allow the free flow of association and alternate pathways and possibilities to remain in mind.  Reportedly, Alan Turing was a fan of crosswords, and it seems that the ability to solve cryptics was a key factor in recruiting people to work on his Enigma code-breaking device during World War II.


Chaperone shedded corset (6)   ESCORT

Common digit yet more deadened (7) EVEN NUMBER

Do in Superman (4)  PERM

According to hearsay, big star is not working (4) IDLE (sounds like idol)

Features of a lion articulated in part of a sentence (4, 6) MAIN CLAUSE (sounds like mane and claws)

Beef and fish (4) CARP (double definition)
